# Description of your program (part 7)
Counting the number of words in a document:
1) Locate the first word in the document.
2) Add one to your word count for the first word.
3) Read each character until a space is the next character.
4) If after the space character the next character is a letter add one to your word count.
5) Repeat steps 3 and 4 until you reach the end of the document.

# Reflection on writing your program (part 8)
The beginning of this assignment I thought it would be easy, but as I started to write instructions out and think about
how they could be perceived incorrectly it got harder to write. I found myself analyzing each word and how it could be
interpreted. While it seems like an easy task to give someone, it can be more complicated than I expected. Once I found
a statement that I didn't think could be misinterpreted I felt pretty great about the assignment.
For this course I'm excited to expand my programming abilities in a new way. I'd love to understand more about how create
beautiful applications not just ones that do what I want with a poor user interface.
